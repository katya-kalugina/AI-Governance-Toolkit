# AI Governance Toolkit: Trustworthiness & Quality Simulator

This repository contains tools designed to operationalize **Responsible AI** by balancing risk-based and quality-based governance approaches.

## 🚀 Interactive Simulator
The core of this toolkit is an interactive model that visualizes the trade-offs between diverse AI trustworthiness characteristics:
- **Data Quality** (ISO/IEC 25012)
- **Product Quality** (ISO/IEC 25059)
- **Quality in Use** (Human-centric effectiveness)

## ⚖️ Research Background
Traditional AI governance often focuses solely on risk mitigation. This project argues that **suboptimal quality itself constitutes a systemic risk**. By utilizing a "computational lens," we can identify the Pareto Frontier where technical reliability, operational safety, and fundamental rights reach an equilibrium.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Framework:** Streamlit (for interactive modeling)
- **Logic:** Based on NIST AI RMF and ISO/IEC 25010/25059 frameworks.
