# AI Governance: Balanced Risk-Quality Model
[**📊 Run Interactive Simulator**](https://ai-governance-toolkit-rgcqpsvbvnfywrrmfa6tv6.streamlit.app)
This repository operationalizes a socio-technical approach to AI Governance, focusing on the equilibrium between risk mitigation and performance quality.

## Project Overview
The core of this toolkit is a computational model designed to visualize and analyze the trade-offs between diverse AI trustworthiness characteristics. In contrast to traditional governance frameworks that focus primarily on harm mitigation, this model incorporates quality dimensions as a prerequisite for ethical AI.

The framework integrates three interconnected quality models:
- **Data Quality** (ISO/IEC 25012): Focuses on the trade-offs between data utility and privacy constraints.
- **Product Quality** (ISO/IEC 25059): Evaluates technical reliability vs. safety-alignment intensity.
- **Quality in Use**: Measures human-centric effectiveness and real-world impact.

## Research Motivation
Traditional AI governance often emphasizes risk mitigation at the expense of system performance. This project argues that **suboptimal quality itself constitutes a significant systemic risk**. By utilizing a "computational lens," the model identifies the Pareto Frontier where technical reliability, operational safety, and the protection of fundamental rights reach a functional equilibrium.

## Technical Implementation
- **Core Logic:** Based on the NIST AI RMF (Trustworthy AI characteristics) and ISO/IEC 25010/25059 frameworks.
- **Methodology:** Computational modeling of trade-offs using Python.
- **Interactive Component:** Developed with Streamlit to allow for empirical testing of governance parameters.
